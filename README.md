# SeleniumGoogleSearch
Test to find something interesting on google.com's search engine

This will use selenium to go to google.com
enter a search string for "coelacanths" which is an ancient sea creature.
and determine (through selenium assertion) that some results come up and relate to a wiki page about it.
